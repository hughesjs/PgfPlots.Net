This project is designed to automate the generation of PGF Plots.

This project is not affiliated with the creators of PGF Plots and I started it to make generating graphs from my research data easier.

The project is currently at a very early stage and is barely functional. I'm always going to appreciate input from anyone who wishes to get involved.
